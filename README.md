# Time Series Forecasting

## Overview

This project explores the use of machine learning models for time series forecasting, leveraging statistical approaches to improve predictive accuracy. The goal is to compare traditional methods with advanced techniques to determine the best forecasting strategy.

## Problem Statement

Time series data is widely used in various domains such as finance, healthcare, and supply chain management. Traditional forecasting models like ARIMA are effective for stationary data but may struggle with complex patterns. This project investigates how machine learning algorithms can enhance time series forecasting by capturing non-linear trends and seasonality.

## Objectives

1. Analyze the time series dataset and explore key patterns.

2. Compare traditional forecasting techniques (e.g., ARIMA, ETS) with machine learning models.

3. Implement models like ARIMA and ETS for predictive analysis.

4. Evaluate performance using standard error metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, MAPE).

## General Analysis of Results

1. The dataset was preprocessed and visualized to identify trends, seasonality, and noise.

2. ARIMA performed well on stationary data but struggled with more complex patterns.

3. ETS (Exponential Smoothing) was useful for capturing trend and seasonality components.

4. Model evaluation metrics confirmed that statistical techniques performed effectively under different conditions.

## Conclusion

The results show that statistical forecasting methods can effectively model time series data, with ARIMA and ETS proving to be reliable approaches. However, future research could explore alternative models for improved accuracy.
