While all the numerous advanced tools and techniques are employed for data analysis such as Machine Learning (ML) one of the techniques frequently preferred for analyzing such data is statistical Time Series Analysis.   We all must have heard that people are saying that the price of different objects has decreased or increased with time, these different objects could be anything like petrol, diesel, gold, silver, edible things, etc. Another example is, the rate of interest fluctuates in banks and different for different kinds of loans. What are all this data, how useful it is? These types of data are time-series data that go through analysis for forecasts. Because of the tremendous variety of conditions, time-series analysis is used by both nature and human beings for communication, description, and data visualizations. Also, time is the physical quantity, and elements, coefficients, parameters, and characteristics of time-series data are mathematical quantities, so time-series can have real-time or real-world interpretations as well. In this writeup the writer employed machine learning for time series forecasting of carbon from 1980 to 2017 in the United States.
